# USB Keybard to BLE Keyboard

## Start
- It's annoying plug-unplug between USB Keyboard and notebook
- But I love my keyboard
- Let's remove connection between KBD and NB

## two things
1. USB-HOST
    - get input from keyboard via USB
    - and convert it to ascii 

2. BLE 
    - connect to notebook via BLE
    - send ascii to notebook
